## Assignments
### 01 Meta
The first assignment consists of two Java applications: the first is a program generator which writes additional `.java` files into the source directory; the second is a test program demonstrating the generator's functionality while passing string parameters as arguments for the invocation.
### 02 Rules
The second assignment is an implementation of rules-based reasoning in Clojure. There are three utility libraries, one each for miscellaneous utilities, rules, and resource manipulation. The `core.js` represents the test that demonstrates the functionality of the reasoning system.
### 03 ID3
The third assignment is an implementation of inference-based reasoning in Java. This application takes a database of elements with a set of attributes and implements a simple ID3 algorithm to group the elements by attribute to yield the greatest amount of information gain per decision.
